## A live demo?
Sure, https://restacked.vercel.app

## How do I host myself?
Fork this, create a postgres database, set the env variables (src/env.js won't let you run otherwise), run `npm run db:push` and deploy!

## Is this complete?
No

## Do you plan on adding light mode?
No, if you want, open a PR
